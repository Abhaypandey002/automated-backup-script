## ☁️ Step 1: Install & Configure `rclone` for Google Drive

### 🔹 Install rclone:
[curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash]  (https://rclone.org/install/#linux)

### 🔹 Create API Client ID and Secret:

1.Go to the Google Cloud Console
2.Create a new project (or use an existing one)
3.Enable the Google Drive API in your project
4.Go to APIs & Services → Credentials
5.Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
6.Choose Desktop App as the application type
7.Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret
8.Under OAuth consent screen, add your Google account under Test Users


## 🛠️ Step 2: Configure rclone

### Open your terminal and run:
  - `rclone config`

### Then follow this step-by-step: 
n) New remote
name> gdrive-enacton
Storage> drive
client_id> [your client_id].apps.googleusercontent.com
client_secret> [your_client_secret]
scope> 1
service_account_file> (leave blank)
Edit advanced config? n
Use web browser to authenticate? y


### A browser will open. Log in and allow access.

**In terminal **
Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)? n
Keep this "gdrive-enacton" remote? y


## 🧪 Step 3: Test the rclone remote
 - `rclone ls gdrive-enacton:`

## 📄 Create a .env File

### Add the following content to a .env file in your project root:
PROJECT_NAME=MyProject
PROJECT_FOLDER=C:/Users/YourUser/Documents/MyProject
RCLONE_REMOTE=gdrive-enacton
RCLONE_FOLDER=Backups
WEBHOOK_URL=https://webhook.site/your-test-url


## Explanation

PROJECT_NAME: Will be used in backup filename
PROJECT_FOLDER: Path to the folder you want to back up
RCLONE_REMOTE: Must match the name you gave in rclone config
RCLONE_FOLDER: Destination folder name in your Google Drive
WEBHOOK_URL: Any webhook for alerting (you can use https://webhook.site)



## 🚀 Run the Backup Script
  - `python backup.py`

### This will:

1. Create a zipped backup of your project folder
2. Save it under backups/daily/
3. Upload it to Google Drive under the folder Backups/
4. Log all actions in backup_logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log
5. Send a webhook notification (if WEBHOOK_URL is set)
